I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), expecting to graduate in May 2026. I possess hands-on expertise in C, C++, and Python, and I have extensive experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, network engineering, and computer security.

Previously, I worked as a Software Development Intern at [Advantech](https://www.advantech.com/en-us) in Summer 2022, where I collaborated with a team to develop intelligent manufacturing solutions. My main focus was updating image classification models and implementing object detection algorithms using PyTorch.

I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index) in 2023. Under the guidance of Prof. [Yong-Sheng Cheng](https://www.cs.nycu.edu.tw/members/detail/yschen?locale=en), I worked on a project, where we designed EEG experiments and developed a model to predict finger movements. This project deepened my knowledge of neural networks and brain-computer interfaces.
