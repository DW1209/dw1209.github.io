I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), expecting to graduate in May 2026. I have hands-on experience with C, C++, and Python, and my interests span machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and network engineering. I also build end-to-end web applications using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks.

In the summer of 2022, I was a Software Development Intern at [Advantech](https://www.advantech.com/en-us), where I collaborated with a team to develop intelligent manufacturing solutions. I primarily worked on improving image classification models and implementing object detection pipelines using PyTorch.

I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index) in 2023. Under the guidance of Prof. [Yong-Sheng Cheng](https://www.cs.nycu.edu.tw/members/detail/yschen?locale=en), I worked on a project where we designed EEG experiments and developed a model to predict finger movements. This project deepened my knowledge of neural networks and brain-computer interfaces.
